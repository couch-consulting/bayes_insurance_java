* add short class description and overview for every class
* rest of docu in code

## Docu
* You have to surround every Netica code with try-catch statements 
* For state of Nodes: If not a string -> N indicates pure Number, R indicates Range
* Only Int Numbers and ranges possible due to netica seeing a "." or "," as state separator 
* "-" is a invalid character thus it will be replaced by "bis"
* Code is stored in the "src/" directory. 
* Ranges are excluding upper limit and including lower limit
* System out println used instead of logger on purpose
